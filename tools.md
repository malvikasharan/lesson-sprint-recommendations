# Tools and Resources

- [Cuckoo](https://cuckoo.team/)
  is a **shared countdown timer** for collaborative co-working sessions.
  Create a page and share the URL with your contributors;
  everyone connected to the page will be notified when the set countdown ends.
  Shared timers such as this can be useful to help coordinate sprint
  sessions between check-ins.
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
  provides a cloud-based development environments for projects.
  The service can deliver an interactive development environment for a project
  on GitHub, with dependencies and environment setup already taken care of,
  allowing contributors to begin working on a project without needing to
  deal with this overhead on their local machine.
  [The GitPod documentation provides instructions to configure your project to use the service](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configuration/).
- Shared note-taking tools:
  - [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/)
  provides a relatively simple shared note-taking interface.
  Useful features include
  colouring to differentiate contributions from individual participants,
  an integrated chat window,
  and line numbering.
  Open Etherpad services include FIXME
  - [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) (formerly CodiMD)
  provides an interface for collaborative writing in Markdown.
  Useful features include
  a split-panel view for simultaneous editing and previewing,
  built-in support for concept mapping with [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org/) and
  [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/),
  and line numbering.
  [The Carpentries provides a CodiMD instance for use in activities and events relating to their community](https://codimd.carpentries.org/),
  and [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) and [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/code/)
  provide similar, free services to a general audience.
  - [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)
  provides an interface for collaborative writing similar
  word processing software such as Microsoft Word.
  Useful features include threaded comments,
  a mode for suggesting changes instead of directly editing the document,
  and visual formatting without the need for text markup.
- [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/)
  provides many services related to conversion between time zones.
  Useful features include
  a meeting planner suggesting suitable times for events with attendees in multiple regions,
  an event announcement system displaying the start time and date of an event converted to the visitor's locale,
  and a time zone converter to check what time it is right now in another location around the world.
- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) and other timezone-aware calendar
  applications can be used to create entries for your event that will automatically
  display in the local time of the person viewing the page/entry.
  Alongside listing event times in UTC with a link to timeanddate.com (see above),
  timezone-aware calendar events are essential to make your sprint inclusive to an international community.
- [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/)
  provides an overview of the backwards lesson design approach recommended for lesson development by The Carpentries.
  It includes guidance on identifying the target audience of your lesson,
  defining meaningful learning objectives,
  designing appropriate examples and exercises,
  and the various stages of the lesson life cycle.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
  provides a workplace messaging platform for threaded text discussion.
  Useful features include multiple open and private channels,
  document and image sharing,
  and a wide range of plugins to interface with other systems.
  Some features require a paid subscription.
  Members of The Carpentries community can
  create a channel for discussion around development of their lesson in
  [the organisation's Slack workspace](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)
- [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) is another instant messaging system similar to
  Slack. It lacks some of the features of Slack but does not require a paid plan
  to remove limits on usage and it integrates well with GitHub,
  e.g. by allowing references to particular repositories, issues, and pull requests.
