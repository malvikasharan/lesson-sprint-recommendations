# After the Sprint

- **List outstanding tasks.** 
  These will help you remember exactly what needs doing when the group next gets together to work on the lesson, 
  and also makes it easier to continue work on the lesson asynchronously.
- **Complete any remaining reviews.**
  Sprints often end with an influx of new material, as contributors finish up what they were working on as the event closed.
  Other material developed earlier in the sprint may be awaiting review.
  Making sure that these are reviewed and (where appropriate) merged into the lesson
  ensures contributors develop a sense of accomplishment from the sprint,
  and ties up any loose ends before new tasks are taken on to develop the material further.
- **Write up an overview of the sprint and share it with your contributors.**
  A summary of progress made and next steps (with links to open issues/work-in-progress pull requests)
  will help you and your contributors appreciate the progress made during your sprint,
  and encourage efforts on the lesson to continue.
  - Consider turning this overview into a blog post to share you experience and achievements with the wider community!
- **Set a date for your next sprint!**
  Lesson development is an iterative process, with feedback and reflections from teaching the material
  often informing a new set of changes and updates to be made.
  Taking time at the end of a sprint, or shortly after, to schedule the next such event,
  ensures that momentum is maintained on development of the lesson and
  that collaborators remain engaged with the process.
  It can also set a deadline for completion of tasks that remain outstanding after the current event.
- **Contribute to these recommendations.**

## Recommendations for GitHub

- **Capture outstanding tasks in new issues on the lesson repository.** 
  You may also wish to assign these to specific contributors for follow up after the sprint.
- **Review open Pull Requests.**
  Ensure any Pull Requests marked as ready for review are processed and (where appropriate) merged.
- **Label issues to encourage asynchronous contributions.**
  Issue labels, such as "help-wanted" and "good-first-issue," provide valuable information to potential contributors
  about where their contributions could be most valuable and how they could begin to get involved with developing
  your lesson.
  Issues labelled "good first issue" will appear automatically on the `/contribute` page of your repository,
  providing a quick overview of ways to get involved that have a low barrier for entry.
  Other labels can be used in a similar way to automatically display listings of issues to potential contributors.
  For example, The Carpentries publishes [a Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/) that provides their community with an overview of
  open issues with the "help-wanted" label on many of their repositories.
- **Clean up branches on your repository.**
  Sprints often leave behind a large number of merged branches that can be removed from the lesson repository.
  Minimising the number of "stale" branches reduces clutter on your repository, allows contributors to name their branches without fear of an unintentional clash 
  and helps people working with local branches.
